The long-term objective in this field is a **virtual cell**: a model of a cell
accurate enough that questions put to it can be believed. Not a lookup table of
experiments already performed, but a representation of how the system operates.

That objective is straightforward to state and difficult to test. The
[Virtual Cell Challenge](https://arcinstitute.org/virtual-cell-initiative), run
annually by the Arc Institute, renders it measurable by **perturbing** the cell:
one gene is switched off, and the model is assessed on whether it anticipated the
response of the remainder. The
[framing paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.008) describes this as a
Turing test for the virtual cell, and the analogy holds. The perturbation is not
the object of interest; it is the interrogation. A model that has captured how a
cell is wired should be able to answer. A model that has memorised outcomes should
not.

I have been working on the 2026 edition, and this post is my introduction to the
problem: for readers who can program but have never handled a pipette, and for
biologists who want to understand why this is a hard modelling problem rather than
a data-cleaning exercise. I define every term at first use, every number and figure
is measured from the challenge data itself, and I state plainly at the end the
sense in which my own approach is not a cell model at all, which is precisely why
it plateaus.

## What is being modelled

The starting point tends to surprise readers arriving from software: **every cell
in the body contains the same genome.** A liver cell and a neuron carry identical
DNA. What differs is which genes each one is *using*.

A gene is a stretch of DNA that is copied into RNA, and that RNA is usually then
translated into a protein that performs some function. **Gene expression** is the
quantity of RNA a cell is currently producing from a given gene, which can be
thought of as a volume control on that gene. The complete set of RNA in a cell is
its **transcriptome**.

![A row of grey gene ticks labelled as the genome, with two rows below showing a liver cell in orange and a neuron in green using different subsets of those same genes at different intensities.](./01-same-genes.svg)
*The same parts list, with a different subset switched on at different volumes. That pattern is the cell type, and it is what sequencing measures.*

A cell type is therefore not a different parts list. It is a different
*configuration* of the same parts list. The genome is the code; expression is the
running process. The term "cell context", used throughout this field, refers to
exactly this: which genes are on, and how strongly.

## Reading a cell one molecule at a time

**Single-cell RNA sequencing** measures that configuration one cell at a time.
Thousands of individual cells are captured, each is tagged with a unique molecular
barcode, everything is sequenced together, and the barcodes are then used to sort
the reads back into per-cell profiles.

The result is a table.

![A table with one row per cell and one column per gene, integer counts in the body, and a label column naming the gene knocked down in each cell.](./02-counts-matrix.svg)
*A knockdown does not change one number. It shifts the whole row slightly, which is visible only by comparing hundreds of cells that received it against hundreds that did not.*

Rows are cells, columns are genes, and each entry counts how many RNA molecules of
that gene were captured in that cell. Approximately **69% of that table is zero**.

The following point is the one that most often misleads those modelling this data
for the first time. **A zero does not indicate that the gene is off.** Sequencing
captures only a sample of the molecules present, so a gene that is genuinely active
can readily produce no reads at all in a given cell. This is termed **dropout**,
although the zeros are
[consistent with ordinary molecule sampling](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-019-0379-5)
rather than with some additional defect of the assay. It is not a rare edge case.

![A rising curve showing the fraction of cells in which a gene is detected against how strongly it is expressed: 2 percent at 1 CPM, 9 percent at 5 CPM, 31 percent at 20 CPM, 79 percent at 100 CPM.](./03-dropout.svg)
*A zero in the matrix frequently means "missed" rather than "off". This is why single cells must be pooled before any claim is made.*

A gene expressed at 5 counts per million, which is a functioning level, is detected
in under **10%** of cells. Even at 20 CPM it appears in roughly a third. Only well
above 100 CPM is it observed in the majority.

The consequence shapes everything downstream: **little can be said about any
individual cell.** Statements become reliable only when hundreds of cells sharing a
condition are pooled. This is why every method discussed here operates on
*populations*, and why, as shown below, submitting a single best-guess cell profile
is catastrophically wrong. The point is not merely conventional. Benchmarks of
single-cell differential expression find that the methods which
[hold up against ground truth](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25960-2) are
precisely those that aggregate cells before testing.

## Switching a gene off as a question

Establishing whether a system is understood requires perturbing it and checking
whether the response was predicted. In a cell, the cleanest available perturbation
is to switch off one gene and observe the remainder.

**CRISPR** is the tool. Its familiar form uses a protein called Cas9, guided to a
chosen position in the genome by a short **guide RNA**, a piece of RNA whose
sequence matches the target, where it cuts the DNA. The variant used here is
**CRISPRi**, or [CRISPR interference](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.02.022).
It employs a Cas9 that has been deliberately disabled so that it can no longer cut.
It parks on the gene's control region and blocks the machinery that reads it, and
[fusing a repressor domain to that inactivated Cas9](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.09.029)
makes the silencing strong and specific enough to operate at genome scale.

The gene is not destroyed but turned down, typically to 10 to 30% of normal. This
is a **knockdown** rather than a knockout, and it is closer to real biology, where
genes are usually modulated rather than deleted.

Combining the two ideas gives the following procedure. A *different* guide RNA is
introduced into each cell in a large pool, so that every cell has a different gene
knocked down, and all of them are then sequenced at once. Each cell reports both
which gene was targeted in it and what happened to the other 18,000 genes. This is
**Perturb-seq**, introduced by
[Dixit et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.038) and
[Adamson et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2016.11.048) in 2016, and a single
experiment can survey hundreds of genes.

Two terms recur throughout. A **perturbation** is one gene knocked down, and a
**context** is a particular kind of cell. The entire difficulty resides in the
interaction between them: the same perturbation in a different context is a
different experiment, and a model that has genuinely captured the cell should
account for why.

## What the challenge asks

The [2025 edition](https://arcinstitute.org/virtual-cell-initiative), the first,
released approximately 300,000 H1 human embryonic stem cells carrying 300 genetic
perturbations, divided into fine-tuning, validation and test segments. Over 5,000
people registered from 114 countries, more than 1,200 teams submitted, and over 300
made final submissions, competing for a $100,000 grand prize sponsored by NVIDIA,
10x Genomics and Ultima Genomics. The accompanying paper, *"[Virtual Cell Challenge:
Toward a Turing test for the virtual
cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.06.008)"*, appeared in *Cell* in 2025.

The structural detail that matters is this. In 2025 the target cell type was
observed under perturbation. Participants had H1 stem cells with many perturbations
measured and predicted *different* perturbations in *that same cell type*. A model
could learn what responses look like in H1 specifically and fill in the gaps, which
is **interpolation**.

The [2026 edition](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2026.08.004) removes that.

![Two grids of cell types by perturbations. In 2025 one cell type has its control and most perturbations measured; in 2026 three new cell types have only their control measured and every perturbation must be predicted.](./08-task-shift.svg)
*In 2025 the model observed one cell type responding and filled the gaps. In 2026 nothing about how the scored cell types respond can be learned before predicting them.*

There is no training set. Knockdown responses must be predicted in cell types never
observed under perturbation, given only those cells at rest and a list of genes to
knock down. This is **zero-shot** prediction, and it demands something categorically
different: whatever the model knows about perturbations must come from *other* cell
types and still apply here.

This is the design decision that converts the competition into a test of modelling
rather than of recall. A cell type that has been observed under perturbation can be
handled well by remembering how it behaved. A cell type observed only *at rest*
admits no such shortcut, and anything predicted must derive from having represented
the cell itself, its state, and how that state shapes a response. That is the claim
a virtual cell makes, and the 2026 design is built to check it.

The problem is genuinely open. Several 2025 benchmarking papers, most pointedly a
*Nature Methods* study named
[scPerturBench](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-025-02980-0), reported that large
single-cell foundation models such as
[scGPT](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-024-02201-0) and
[Geneformer](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06139-9) frequently fail to beat a
trivial baseline predicting the same average response for every perturbation, and
attributed this to inadequate representation of cellular context. A
[separate *Nature Methods* comparison](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-025-02772-6)
reported the same result more bluntly: none of the five foundation models and two
further deep-learning models it tested beat deliberately simple linear baselines.
The field's largest models are therefore not yet demonstrably modelling the cell
either.

## Examining the data before modelling anything

Three questions are worth answering before any model code is written.

**How much signal is present in one cell?**

![Three curves, one per context, of the number of genes detected per cell out of the 18,533 measured. All three peak just above the marked median of 5,939.](./04-genes-per-cell.svg)
*A typical cell reports about 5,900 of 18,533 genes, and nearly half the transcriptome is effectively silent in any one context.*

A typical cell yields around 20,000 RNA molecules distributed across roughly
**5,939 distinct genes out of 18,533**. In addition, **47% of genes sit below 5
CPM** in any given context, and 14% are not detected at all. This is not a defect
but cell identity again. A skin cell does not run the neuronal program.

![Three stacked bars, one per context, splitting all 18,533 genes into silent, barely on, moderate and strong slices. Every context is about 13 to 15 percent silent and a further 33 percent barely on.](./05-transcriptome-mix.svg)
*Half of every transcriptome is silent or barely on, and a gene that is off cannot be knocked down any further.*

The consequence for the task is blunt: **a gene that is already off cannot be
knocked down any further.** It can still be induced, and later sections return to
what that costs, but a downward prediction for a silent gene has nowhere to go, and
an upward one has to be read off a baseline near zero, which is exactly where the
measurement is least reliable.

**Are the three test contexts actually different?**

Viewing 18,000 dimensions at once requires projection. **PCA**, or principal
component analysis, identifies the directions along which the cells differ most and
plots the first two. It is a rigid rotation of the data, so the distances displayed
are real distances. This is worth stating, because the other embedding common in
this field, [UMAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426), preserves neighbourhood
structure but not distance.

![A scatter plot of the first two principal components of all 55,200 control cells. Three well-separated clouds, blue for context A, orange for B, green for C.](./06-pca.svg)
*PCA is a rigid rotation, so these distances are real. A cell's control profile alone is sufficient to identify which context it came from.*

Every one of the 55,200 control cells is plotted. Three tight, well-separated
clouds result, so the control cells alone identify their context before any
perturbation.

This matters more than it initially appears. The control cells are the *only*
description of the target cell that is provided, and they are evidently a rich one,
since they identify the context unambiguously. Everything a model could know about
these cells is contained in them. The question the challenge poses is whether that
description can be converted into a prediction of how the cell will respond, which
is the virtual-cell claim in miniature.

**How do the contexts differ, gene by gene?**

![Three scatter plots comparing control expression of every gene between pairs of contexts, with correlations of 0.78, 0.75 and 0.84 and over a thousand genes differing more than tenfold in each pair.](./07-context-vs-context.svg)
*Aggregate distributions match almost exactly; individual genes do not. That gap is what makes a context a context.*

The aggregate expression distributions of the three contexts are nearly
superimposable; plotted as histograms they would be taken for replicates. Gene by
gene they correlate at 0.75 to 0.84, and each pair contains **over a thousand genes
differing more than tenfold**. Some are fully on in one context and silent in
another.

That gap is what makes a context a context. It is also precisely what a model has
to get right.

## Identifying contexts A, B and C

The challenge does not disclose them. The three contexts arrive as anonymous
populations of cells, which is reasonable, since the task is to predict rather than
to look the answer up. The control profiles are nonetheless informative enough to
separate the contexts cleanly, which raises the question of whether they are
informative enough to *name* them.

One point should be stated first. These are the **validation** cell lines, used for
the public leaderboard. The final entry is scored on three *different* held-out
lines whose control profiles are released later. The
[official rules](https://virtualcellchallenge.org/rules) set out that split, and
they also permit published experimental data as *training* material while
forbidding its use as an answer, which is what makes the analysis below admissible
rather than an exploit. What follows is therefore an analysis of the practice
problem, not a route to the examination.

**The data.** [DepMap](https://depmap.org/portal/) publishes bulk RNA-seq for over
1,600 human cancer cell lines and is the
[standard reference atlas](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1186-3) for questions
of this kind. The profiles used here come from the
[24Q4 public release](https://doi.org/10.25452/figshare.plus.27993248). Each
context supplies tens of thousands of unperturbed cells, which sum into a pseudobulk
profile that is comparable in kind.

**The method**, with two adjustments that matter more than the correlation itself.

Single-cell pseudobulk and bulk RNA-seq have different capture biases, so the
absolute similarity between them is not meaningful and only the *ranking* of
candidates can be used. Furthermore, every human cell runs the same ribosomal and
metabolic machinery, so a raw correlation is high for every pair and carries no
information. The discriminating signal resides in genes that vary *between* cell
lines, so the comparison uses the 3,000 most variable genes in the reference, with
each profile centred on the reference mean before correlating. What remains is the
component of a profile that makes a cell line that particular cell line.

$$
r_i \;=\; \cos\!\big(\, \mathbf{q} - \bar{\mathbf{R}},\;\; \mathbf{R}_i - \bar{\mathbf{R}} \,\big)
$$

Here $\mathbf{q}$ is the context's profile over the variable genes, $\mathbf{R}_i$
is reference line $i$, and $\bar{\mathbf{R}}$ is the mean across all reference
lines. Subtracting $\bar{\mathbf{R}}$ from both sides removes the shared
housekeeping signal, and the candidates are then ranked by $r_i$.

![Three panels, one per context, ranking the closest matches among 1,673 reference cell lines. Context A matches Jurkat and four other lymphoid lines; context B matches HeLa by a wide margin; context C matches CAL33 and four other head-and-neck lines.](./18-what-are-abc.svg)
*The top hit is suggestive; the fact that its neighbours share its tissue is what makes it convincing.*

**The results are unambiguous.**

Context **A** matches **[Jurkat](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0065)**, an
immortalised T-lymphocyte line, at 0.87, which is 0.12 clear of the runner-up and
more than four standard deviations above the field. Context **B** matches
**[HeLa](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_0030)**, the most widely used cell line in
biology, by the widest margin of the three, at 0.70 against 0.38 for anything else.
Context **C** matches **[CAL33](https://www.cellosaurus.org/CVCL_1108)**, a
head-and-neck squamous carcinoma line, at 0.76.

The single best hit is suggestive; the company it keeps is what makes the
identification convincing. Every one of A's top five is a lymphoid line. Every one
of C's top five is head-and-neck. B's runner-up field is more mixed, but its winning
margin is more than twice that of any other context. The evidence is not that one
line correlates slightly better, but that an entire neighbourhood of the atlas is
the correct tissue and one line within it stands apart.

**Why this is informative rather than merely satisfying.** It establishes what kind
of transfer problem each context represents. The public perturbation screens I use
as training data, introduced in the next section, cover three activation states of
CD4 T cells. Those are a different cell type from Jurkat, but the same **lineage**,
meaning they descend from the same broad developmental family, in this case the
lymphoid one. Nothing in the pool comes from cervix or head-and-neck tissue.
Context A is therefore the only one of the three with even a lineage match
available, and a later section shows how sharply agreement between two screens
falls once the cell type changes at all. Any honest reading of an overall score has
to account for two of the three contexts having no lineage-matched screen in the
pool.

It also demonstrates how much a control profile discloses. A model that uses those
cells only as a substrate to multiply against, as the one described below does, is
leaving identifiable and structured information unused.

## Transferring effects from other cell types

With no perturbation data available in the target contexts, the only option is to
transfer measurements made elsewhere. Public Perturb-seq datasets exist for several
human cell lines, so the effect of each knockdown can be measured in those lines
and carried across.

![A table of six public screens listing cell type, tissue, number of perturbations, and how many of the 300 panel genes each covers.](./09-donor-screens.svg)
*Coverage is not the constraint: 269 of the 300 panel genes were perturbed in all six screens.*

I use six screens, spanning blood, colon, kidney and immune cells, the last of
these in three activation states, which turns out to matter. They are the
genome-scale K562 screen of
[Replogle et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.05.013), the HCT116 and
HEK293T screens of
[X-Atlas/Orion](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.06.11.659105), and the resting and
stimulated CD4 T-cell screens of
[Zhu et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2026.08.002). I rebuilt every one from raw counts through a single pipeline rather than taking
the authors' published fold changes. This sounds fussy and is not: different papers use different
normalisations, pseudocounts and definitions of control, so mixing published effect
sizes silently mixes estimators, and every downstream comparison inherits the
resulting confusion.

Coverage is not the bottleneck. **269 of the 300 panel genes were perturbed in all
six screens.**

The quantity carried over is the **log fold change**: for each knockdown, how much
each gene moved relative to untouched control cells, on a log scale so that a
doubling and a halving are equal and opposite.

![A flow diagram: control cells and perturbed cells both feed into a step that averages each population gene by gene, which feeds into a step that divides the two averages and takes a log, giving one number per gene.](./10-effect-numbers.svg)
*Repeating this for all 18,533 genes gives one row, and for all 300 perturbations gives the whole table. That table is the entire model.*

$$
e_{pg} \;=\; \log_2 \frac{\bar{x}^{\,p}_{g} + \varepsilon}
                            {\bar{x}^{\,\mathrm{ctrl}}_{g} + \varepsilon}
$$

Here $\bar{x}^{\,p}_{g}$ is the average of gene $g$ across cells in which $p$ was
knocked down, $\bar{x}^{\,\mathrm{ctrl}}_{g}$ is the same quantity in untouched
cells, and $\varepsilon$ is a small constant preventing a gene absent from
one side from sending the ratio to infinity. Base 2 means that $+1$ is a doubling
and $-1$ a halving.

Stacking those numbers into a table with one row per perturbation and one column per
gene gives what is referred to below as the **effect table**.

![Left: a heatmap of 24 perturbations by 60 genes, blue where a gene goes down and red where it goes up. Right: the distribution of log fold changes, sharply peaked at zero.](./11-effect-table.svg)
*Most of the table is zero or near-zero; the signal is a thin scatter of genes that genuinely move.*

Two features stand out. **59% of its entries are exactly zero**, and that is a
decision rather than an observation. I set to zero every gene whose expression in
that screen's control cells falls below 5 counts per million. A silent gene can of
course be induced by a perturbation, and some are, but a fold change computed
against a near-zero denominator is dominated by sampling noise, and the challenge's
differential-expression components discard genes below that level in any case, so an
effect predicted there cannot score. The cost of the gate is that genuine inductions
of silent genes are discarded along with the noise. The median non-zero change is
**0.10 on a log2 scale**, which is approximately a 7% shift. The heatmap displays the
resulting texture: mostly near-nothing, with occasional rows where a perturbation
moves many genes at once, and a thin scatter of real effects elsewhere.

That table is the object the method is betting on, which raises the question of
whether it survives a change of cell type.

## The measurement that makes this hard

That question can be answered directly. Take two screens, identify the perturbations
both measured, and compute how similar their effect vectors are.

It is worth being honest about what this looks like on the page. Neither scatter
below shows an obvious diagonal, because a cosine of 0.33 between two noisy
18,000-dimensional vectors is a shallow tilt buried in a dense cloud. The signal
becomes visible only when the cloud is summarised: taking the median effect in the
second screen within bins of the first traces a line that climbs steadily on the
left panel and wanders around zero on the right. The same contrast appears in a
simpler statistic. Within one cell type, 58% of genes move in the same direction in
both screens; across cell types, 47% do, which is chance.

![Two scatter plots, one point per gene, each carrying a binned-median trend line. Same cell type at different states, agreement 0.33: the trend line rises across the panel and 58 percent of genes move the same way in both screens. Different cell types, agreement 0.02: the trend line is flat and 47 percent of genes move the same way, which is chance.](./12-agreement-scatter.svg)
*Both clouds look alike, which is the point: at this level of agreement the signal is not visible in the scatter and has to be drawn out. The trend line is what separates them.*

![A bar chart of agreement between pairs of screens on the same perturbation. Pairs that are the same cell type in different activation states reach 0.25 to 0.33; every pair of different cell types falls between 0.016 and 0.037.](./13-donor-agreement.svg)
*A tenfold drop the moment cell types are crossed. This single number is the whole difficulty of the task.*

**The same cell type in different states**, meaning CD4 T cells resting against
stimulated for 8 or 48 hours, gives agreement of **0.25 to 0.33**. This is not
high, but it is clearly real.

**Different cell types** give agreement of **0.016 to 0.037**, for every such pair
without exception. That is a **tenfold collapse** as soon as the cell type
changes.

This single measurement is the whole difficulty of the challenge. Knocking out a
gene in a blood cell and in a kidney cell produces effects that are, in direction,
almost unrelated. The shared, generic component of a stress response transfers
adequately. The component specific to *which gene was targeted* barely transfers at
all, and that specific component is exactly what the scoring rewards, since it is
what distinguishes one perturbation from another.

It also explains the benchmark results. If the transferable signal is this thin, a
large model has very little to be large about.

## Constructing the prediction, and what it sidesteps

Given the effect table, one decision remains, and it is the most consequential in
the pipeline.

![Two flow diagrams. The first goes from a model directly to absolute expression. The second multiplies control cells from the target context by a fold change measured elsewhere.](./14-what-to-predict.svg)
*Which genes are on, at what level, and how much cells vary: all of it arrives with the target's own control cells.*

The tempting approach is to have a model output the perturbed cell's expression
directly. The better approach, and the one I take, is to predict only the *change*
and apply it to control cells drawn from the target context.

The reason is that those control cells already encode everything context-specific
at no cost: which genes are on, at what level, and with how much cell-to-cell
variation. None of it has to be modelled, and none of it can be got wrong. What
remains is the narrower question of how much each gene moves.

It is worth being explicit about what this manoeuvre is. **It is not a model of the
cell.** It is a means of not requiring one. The target cell's state is not
represented, learned or reasoned about. It is imported wholesale, by starting from
the target's own cells and only ever predicting a change on top of them. The change
itself comes from measurements in other cell types, unmodified.

That is why it works well and quickly, and it is equally the ceiling built into it.
Every context-specific property the prediction gets right, it gets right by copying
rather than by understanding, and copying cannot indicate how *this* cell will
respond differently from those copied from.

Assembled, the pipeline has two steps.

![A two-step pipeline. Step one combines six public screens by weighted average into a 300 by 18,533 effect table. Step two multiplies that table by control cells from a target context and resamples counts into 400 predicted cells per perturbation.](./15-pipeline.svg)
*Step one never sees the target contexts. Step two runs once per context, and everything specific to that context arrives with its own cells.*

Step one occurs once and knows nothing about the target contexts. Step two runs per
context and is where the target's own biology enters. The effect table is the model;
everything else is bookkeeping.

## Early attempts and what they establish

I want to be concrete about my early and unsuccessful versions, because each
failure identifies something the working version depends on.

![A scale from minus one to one. A bar for 400 identical cells extends to minus 0.81, the generic baseline sits at zero, a first transfer baseline sits just above it, and a dashed line marks the replicate anchor at one.](./16-simple-baselines.svg)
*The naive submission is not merely weak. It is far worse than predicting nothing, because several scoring components run tests that require variation between cells.*

**Predicting one average response for everything.** This is the scoring rule's zero
point and therefore scores 0 by construction. It is nonetheless a genuine strategy:
if perturbation effects were mostly a shared stress response it would be difficult
to beat, and it is the baseline the benchmark papers found foundation models
struggling to exceed.

**Predicting 400 identical cells carrying the correct average profile.** This feels
*more* accurate than the preceding idea and scores dramatically worse, at
approximately **−0.81**, far below predicting nothing. Several scoring components
run statistical tests for differential expression, comparing perturbed cells against
controls, and those tests require cell-to-cell variation. Supplied with 400 copies
of one profile, the variance is zero, the tests degenerate, and the components
collapse. This is the dropout lesson from earlier arriving with a cost attached:
**the submission is a population, and its spread is part of the prediction.**

**Applying one other cell line's measured effects.** This clears zero modestly and
was sufficient for rank 167. It is a weak model, but it establishes the property
everything else depends on: perturbation effects do partially transfer.

Combining all six screens and taking care over how the simulated cells are generated
moved it from **rank 167 to 58, and then to 45**. I stop short of the specifics of the better-performing versions, since the
competition is still running and detailing them would not be in its spirit.

## How submissions are scored

A submission consists of simulated cells: 400 for every (context, perturbation)
pair, amounting to 360,000 cells by 18,533 genes. Six components are computed and
averaged by the challenge's
[`cell-eval`](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/cell-eval) scorer. They are worth
treating individually, because they do not measure the same thing and a change that
helps one routinely harms another.

**The common scale.** Every component begins as a raw quantity `u`, which is then
rescaled against a **baseline** `b`, the score of a generic average response, and an
**anchor**, the score of a perfect prediction. For components where lower is better
and perfect is zero:

$$
s \;=\; 1 - \frac{u}{b}
$$

and for those where higher is better and perfect is one,
$s = (u - b)\,/\,(1 - b)$. A score of **0 therefore means no better than predicting
one average response for everything**, and **1 means as good as repeating the
experiment**, with the real cells split in half and one half scored against the
other. That upper anchor is the honest one: reaching it means being as close to the
truth as the biology is to itself.

Notation is fixed once. For perturbation $p$, $\mathbf{d}_p$ denotes the predicted
change and $\boldsymbol{\Delta}_p$ the true one, both vectors over the 18,533 genes.
The symbol $b$ denotes the baseline value of whichever raw quantity is under
discussion.

### 1. Perturbation discrimination: was *this* perturbation predicted?

For each perturbation, the predicted change is compared against the true change of
**all 300** perturbations, and the rank of the correct one is recorded:

$$
u_p \;=\; 1 - \frac{\operatorname{rank}_p}{D}
\qquad\text{where}\qquad
\operatorname{rank}_p = \big|\{\, q : d_{\cos}(\mathbf{d}_p, \boldsymbol{\Delta}_q) < d_{\cos}(\mathbf{d}_p, \boldsymbol{\Delta}_p) \,\}\big|
$$

Here $\operatorname{rank}_p$ counts how many *incorrect* answers the prediction
resembles more closely than the correct one, using cosine distance:

$$
d_{\cos}(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) \;=\; 1 - \frac{\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}}{\lVert\mathbf{u}\rVert\,\lVert\mathbf{v}\rVert}.
$$

Ranking the correct answer first scores 1; landing in the middle scores 0.5, which
is chance.

This is a *retrieval* metric rather than an accuracy metric. It does not ask whether
the prediction is close to the truth, but whether it is closer to the correct truth
than to the 299 incorrect ones. Because the distance is a **cosine**, it is entirely
blind to magnitude: scaling every prediction by ten changes nothing.

### 2. Expression accuracy: is the predicted profile close?

$$
u \;=\; \frac{\sum_p \big\lVert \mathbf{d}_p - \boldsymbol{\Delta}_p \big\rVert^2}
              {\sum_p \big\lVert \boldsymbol{\Delta}_p \big\rVert^2}
$$

This is squared error between predicted and true change, divided by the size of the
true change, summed over perturbations. Unlike discrimination it registers
magnitude: a prediction pointing in the correct direction but twice too far is
penalised.

### 3. Fold-change accuracy: are the sizes correct?

This component is restricted to genes that genuinely changed in the real data:

$$
u_p \;=\; \frac{\sum_{g \in G_p} \big| \ell^{\,\mathrm{pred}}_{pg} - \ell^{\,\mathrm{real}}_{pg} \big|}
                {\sum_{g \in G_p} \big| \ell^{\,\mathrm{real}}_{pg} \big|}
$$

with $\ell$ the log fold change and $G_p$ the set of genes that genuinely changed.

The name refers to magnitude, but the absolute difference makes this a direction
metric as well, and sharply so. Taking one gene and reading off its contribution to
the numerator, in units of $|\ell^{\,\mathrm{real}}|$:

| prediction | cost |
|---|---|
| correct, right size | $0$ |
| nothing ($\ell^{\,\mathrm{pred}} = 0$) | $1$ |
| right size, **wrong sign** | $2$ |

A sign error therefore costs exactly as much *more* than remaining silent as a
correct call saves. Direction is first-order here rather than a secondary
consideration: getting it backwards is worse than predicting no change at all.

The middle row is also the reason this component has a hard floor. **Predicting
nothing everywhere makes the numerator equal to the denominator**, landing exactly
on the reference point. Predicting zero is not free, since everything else is
forfeited, but it is a floor this component alone cannot push a submission below.

### 4. Direction fidelity: the right genes, moving the right way?

$$
u_p \;=\; \frac{k_p}{\max\!\big(n^{\mathrm{pred}}_p,\; n^{\mathrm{conf}}_p\big)}
$$

Here `k` counts genes flagged as changed whose direction matches the reference,
`n_pred` is how many were flagged, and `n_conf` how many the reference is confident
about. The `max` in the denominator is the notable feature: flagging too few allows
`n_conf` to dominate, flagging too many allows `n_pred` to dominate. Both are
penalised, so the component cannot be gamed by calling everything or nothing.

### 5. Direction reach: how deep does the ranking stay correct?

Predicted changes are ranked by confidence and traversed, tracking the running
fraction whose direction is correct. Let `k*` be the deepest point at which that
fraction is still at least 0.9:

$$
k^{*}_p \;=\; \max\big\{\, k \;:\; P_p(k) \ge 0.9 \,\big\},
\qquad
u_p \;=\; \frac{k^{*}_p}{n^{\mathrm{conf}}_p}
$$

where $P_p(k)$ is the fraction of the top-$k$ predicted genes whose direction is
correct.

Fidelity asks whether the calls are correct. Reach asks how far down the ordering
survives before it ceases to be correct, and therefore rewards a well-ordered
prediction rather than merely an accurate one.

### 6. Significance overlap: were the same genes flagged?

$$
u_p \;=\; \frac{\lvert R_p \cap P_p \rvert}{\lvert R_p \cup P_p \rvert}
$$

Here `R` is the set of genes significantly changed in the real data and `P` the set
in the prediction, with the knocked-down gene itself excluded from both, since
reporting that the targeted gene went down is the premise of the experiment rather
than a prediction. This is a plain Jaccard index: of all genes flagged by either
side, what fraction was flagged by both.

### What this means in practice

![A grid of the six scored components against four things a submission controls: direction, magnitude, how many genes are called changed, and cell-to-cell variation. Filled circles mark strong sensitivity, half circles weak, empty circles none.](./17-metric-sensitivity.svg)
*Discrimination is blind to magnitude. Fold-change accuracy responds strongly to both, since a sign error costs double what silence does. The three differential-expression components all require cell-to-cell spread.*

Reading that grid explains why the task resists easy gains.

**Discrimination cannot register magnitude at all**, because a cosine is
scale-invariant. Fold-change accuracy registers both strongly, direction through the
doubled cost of a sign error and magnitude directly.

That combination makes the trade-off subtle rather than obvious. Direction and
magnitude are not opposed *within the metrics*, and improving direction genuinely
helps both components. The difficulty is that the operations available to me for
sharpening direction, such as reweighting genes, recombining screens and
decorrelating predictions, almost all disturb magnitude as a side effect, and
fold-change accuracy charges for that immediately. Several quite different ideas of
mine landed on nearly the same overall score for this reason: whatever direction
they bought was returned through the magnitudes they disturbed. The useful question
proved to be not which component I could push, but whether the underlying
prediction was actually more accurate, since only that moves several components at
once without incurring a cost.

The right-hand column explains the identical-cells result described earlier. The
three differential-expression components all depend on statistical tests comparing
predicted perturbed cells against controls, and those tests require **cell-to-cell
variation**. Emitting 400 copies of one profile sets the variance to zero, the tests
degenerate, and half the scoreboard collapses, which is how a submission can land
far below predicting nothing.

## Why the problem remains hard

Measurement noise is larger than intuition suggests. In a
[2026 Perturb-seq dataset](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.33273600) spanning 16
cell lines, each gene was targeted by two independent guide RNAs in the same line.
Those are two measurements of the same biological quantity, and they agree only
modestly, not far above the agreement between *different* cell lines. Since
predictions are scored against one noisy measurement, some of the apparent error is
irreducible, and some of what appears to be poor transfer is the noise floor of the
assay showing through.

The deeper reason is the one from the preceding section, and the screen-agreement
figure is where it becomes concrete. Effects transfer between cell types at a cosine
of approximately **0.02**. A method built on copying measured effects is therefore
working through a channel that is almost closed, and no amount of care in *how* the
copying is done will widen it, because the information is simply not present in the
source.

What would widen it is a model that represents the target cell and derives the
response from that representation, rather than importing a response measured
elsewhere. That is the virtual-cell claim, and Arc's own
[State](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2026.07.052) model is an attempt at exactly
it. This challenge is a fair test of that claim precisely because it withholds every
opportunity to substitute recall for understanding.

## Conclusion and future work

The 2026 challenge is a considerably cleaner test than the 2025 one. Withholding
perturbation data entirely for the scored cell types stops rewarding models that
memorise one cell type and forces the real question: has anything general been
learned about how genes regulate one another?

My own results indicate that a careful and simple approach reaches surprisingly
far, that my largest early gains came from respecting the structure of the data
rather than from model capacity, and that the remaining gap is not obviously closed
by building something larger. The tenfold drop in agreement once the
cell type changes is, in my view, the single most important number for anyone
beginning work on this problem.

Here is where I would take it next.

- **Establish the noise floor before pursuing accuracy.** If two guides against the
  same gene in the same cell line agree only moderately, the ceiling on any
  predictor is lower than the metric implies, and the appropriate target may be the
  reproducible component of the response rather than the measurement itself.
- **Convert the control profile into a model rather than a starting point.** The
  embeddings show that the control cells identify their context unambiguously, so
  the information is present. Using it only as a substrate to multiply against is
  the shortcut; learning how that state *modulates* a response is the actual
  problem, and the one worth failing at.
- **Treat public perturbation data as one dataset rather than many.** Rebuilding
  everything from raw counts through a single pipeline is unglamorous and repaid
  itself immediately.
- **Design for the population rather than the average.** The identical-cells failure
  is the clearest lesson of the exercise: the distribution emitted is part of the
  prediction, not a presentation detail.
